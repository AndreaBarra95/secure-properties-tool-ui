# Secure Properties Tool - UI

This tool is created to encrypt and decrypt properties by using Blowfish CBC or AES CBC Algorithm. We took inspiration from MuleSoft secure-properties-tool.jar which can be executed using maven.
However, it is usually needed to write scripts on command line. 

On the other hand, this tool helps the developers to avoid using the command prompt. Therefore, thanks to the UI, everyone can encrypt or decrypt properties faster.

The entire project has been developed with Python.
